_Hey ya_, thanks for visiting. My name is David Michael Schulman (he/him) and I'm an enthusiastic frontend web developer based out of **Philadelphia, PA**. I design and build lightweight, accessible, and minimal-inspired web applications using an ever-evolving set of tools and tactics. In my current role at [Saint Joseph's University](https://www.sju.edu/) I oversee the university's public-facing web presence across multiple stacks.

In my spare time I like to travel (mostly by bike), build electronics (mainly synthesizers and sound modules), attend and perform live music, take photographs, write, and work with my hands. You'll find me documenting most of those experiences here on this very website! Of course I'm keeping it short and sweet, but you can read more about my background and what got me into tech in the first place [here](bio.html).
